The website is a design concept that I plan to implement on my future business where I wil be providing web development and other IT related services for people in Nairobi, Kenya
It consists of a homepage, about, contact and login page each designed to be responsive for all screen sizes. 
I believe that with more cs50 lesos, such could be deployed into an actual website where the login, signup and contact sections could be actually functional using sql, php or other data managing and input processing web platforms
